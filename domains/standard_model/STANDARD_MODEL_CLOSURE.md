# Standard Model — Closure Ledger (v0.4, honest)

> **What "closed" means here.** We close what is provable and mark the wall precisely. This is
> **not** a derivation of the Standard Model from the retained root. The honest headline:
> **three layers close in FINITE BLIND FIXTURES, the radiative engine closes only to a FINITE
> SPECTRAL DIAGNOSTIC, and the physical Standard Model from the root is STILL OPEN** — with
> exactly **three** remaining bottlenecks (down from four).

Every row points at a runnable verifier (`… .py`, PASS) and/or a machine-checked Coq witness
(`… .v`, `Print Assumptions` **Closed over ℚ**). Run them all: `python3 run_tests.py`.

## The pipeline (what each stage does and its honest tier)

| **Physical SM end-to-end** | — | 🟥 **OPEN** | — |

## What is genuinely closed (do not undersell)
- The **gauge substrate** (connection/holonomy/curvature) and the **order defect** are `Th_coqc`.
- Given the SM one-generation **rep content as a finite fixture**, the **hypercharges are forced**
  by anomaly + coupling closure, the **cubic anomaly cancels exactly**, and these are the real SM
  values — all machine-checked over ℚ, with **no charge fed in**.
- The **photon's masslessness emerges** from a rank-1 obstruction (not imported), and the
  electroweak decoder calibrates to CODATA/PDG with a held-out tree-level `M_Z` at 0.011%.
- The discriminators are **blind**: the group, the reps, the charges, and L/R are never inputs;
  every stage carries a **failing/negative control**.
- **The color number 3 and SU(3) are conditionally derived** from the ordered closed tape — the
  *oddness* of the minimal closure is a theorem (`(−1)^{k−1}=1`), not "nature has three colors" — and
  a **first dynamical-confinement result** (area law `V(R)=σR`) is exact in the Z₃/2D center sector.

## The wall — what must NOT be claimed (three bottlenecks, honestly)
End-to-end **physical Standard Model from the root = 0%**. The remaining bottlenecks are **three**:
1. **Root-derived orientation / spin-statistics** — the pipeline uses a *given* `J_ord`; deriving a
   physical chirality operator from the retained root is open (so chirality is *conditional*).
2. **Gauge-orbit fluctuation Hessian** — the radiative `(r1,r2,r3)` are raw finite log-det
   curvatures; without the exact orbit-volume (ghost) subtraction, polarization counting, and a
   single-action gauge-carrier Hessian they are **not** one-loop SM β-coefficients.
3. **Continuum / held-out radiative validation** — no large-graph limit, no regulator-independence,
   no held-out coupling-flow comparison has been run.

Also not derived from the root (finite BLIND fixtures supply them): the **rep content itself**, the
**count** (why exactly `u(1)×su(2)×su(3)`), and any **physical coupling value**. `α`, masses, and
`θ_W` remain **rejected-not-faked / calibration inputs**.

**On color/confinement specifically** (v0.2–v0.6): SU(3) and its Z₃ center are *conditionally* derived
(oddness of the minimal closure a theorem); center-sector confinement is exact in Z₃/2D (v0.3); a
**computable SU(3) confinement certificate** `𝔠_t=μ_4·ρ_t<1` is rigorous for `0<κ<0.0020252` (all reps)
with a candidate window `κ≲0.053` (v0.5); and the **block-scale existence theorem** (v0.6) dissolves the
old "does κ flow into the window?" wall — since `ρ_t(b)=ρ_t^{b²}`, spectral contraction always beats the
finite surface entropy `μ_4`, so **some** coarse scale `b_*` certifies confinement whenever the
per-cell triality retention `0<ρ_t<1`. What is **still open**: the 4D correlation defect `ε_t(b)`, the
full block kernel `K_b` and `ρ_t^full(b)` for `b=2` computed from the real action (the sharpened wall —
a finite integral, not a debate), a representation-tail bound, the exact admissible-surface `μ_4`, and a
nonzero **continuum** `σ_phys`. (The Wilson area-law criterion, the center's role, and character/
convolution blocking are standard lattice-gauge results — not new here; the *reading* as retained-triality
contraction is the in-framework contribution.)

## One-line verdict
> **Algebra + representations + hypercharges + anomaly cancellation: FINITE BLIND / Th_coqc closed.
> Chirality: conditional. Radiative engine: finite diagnostic. Physical Standard Model from the
> root: OPEN — three bottlenecks.** Saying exactly this is the closure.
