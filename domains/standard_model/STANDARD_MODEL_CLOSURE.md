# Standard Model — Closure Ledger (v1.13, node-level)

> **What "closed" means here.** We close what is provable and mark the wall precisely. This is
> **not** a derivation of the Standard Model from the unrestricted retained root. The honest
> headline: **many nodes close, each at its own tier — some `Th_coqc` from the substrate, most
> `EXACT WITHIN A DECLARED FINITE ARCHITECTURE` (a minimal alphabet, a carrier, a coarse-reader
> map) — and the end-to-end physical Standard Model from the unrestricted root is STILL OPEN.**
> Do not compress this into "three remaining bottlenecks" — the open surface has grown *more*
> precise, not smaller; see §3.

Every row points at a runnable verifier (`… .py`, PASS) and/or a machine-checked Coq witness
(`… .v`, `Print Assumptions` **Closed over ℚ**). Run them all: `python3 run_tests.py` (24
verifiers + 26 Coq witnesses as of SM-G0.1-G0.6, all PASS/Closed).

**Status vocabulary** used below (never blur these):
- `EXACT` — a genuine root-native `Th_coqc` result, no declared finite architecture needed.
- `EXACT_WITHIN_DECLARED_ARCHITECTURE` — `Th_coqc`, but conditional on a stated minimal alphabet /
  carrier / gate set (e.g. the blind matter search's `{1,3,3̄}×{1,2}` alphabet, or v1.9's binary
  orientation+incidence carrier). Uniqueness/derivation claims are scoped to that architecture only.
- `CONDITIONAL` — exact given an unproven premise from elsewhere in the arc (e.g. weak chirality
  given `⟨Ξ⟩≠0`; order condensation given `Π₀>α`).
- `FINITE_FIXTURE` — a blind/finite-blind discriminator result, not yet a root Coq witness.
- `NUMERICAL_NOT_INTERVAL` — high-precision numerical, not a rigorous interval/exact-rational proof.
- `CALIBRATION_ONLY` — fit to CODATA/PDG for consistency-checking, not a prediction.
- `OPEN` — not established here.
- `SUPERSEDED` — a prior result in this ledger that is now known WRONG and must not be cited.

---

## What is genuinely closed (do not undersell)
- The **gauge substrate** (connection/holonomy/curvature) and the **order defect** are `EXACT`
  (root-native `Th_coqc`, no declared architecture needed).
- Within their declared architectures: hypercharges + Z₆ quotient, a **blind** one-generation
  matter skeleton (found, not fed), an ordered-tape chirality grading + exact no-go, a
  Ginsparg–Wilson kinetic operator with no doubling in the free fixture, a **derived** `d=4`, an
  isotropic fixed point whose mixing weights are themselves derived from a reflection-positive
  slab of the action, a **forced** minimal order carrier with its vector mass-rank pattern, and a
  corrected order-vacuum criterion from actual intertwiner-rank counting — all `Th_coqc`.
- The photon's masslessness **emerges** from a rank-1 obstruction (not imported); the electroweak
  decoder calibrates to CODATA/PDG with a held-out tree-level `M_Z` at 0.011%.
- Every discriminator/search this session is **blind**: the skeleton, the reps, the charges, the
  order carrier are never fed; every stage carries a failing/negative control.

## §11. The wall — what must NOT be claimed
End-to-end **physical Standard Model from the unrestricted root = 0%**. The open surface is now
tracked **per node** (§1–§10 above), not as a fixed bottleneck count — collapsing it back into
"three bottlenecks" would hide real progress on some fronts and real gaps on others. The load-
bearing open items, by category: all 6 structural sub-gates of SM-G0 are now closed as Coq witnesses
(§1; G0.1/G0.2 2026-07-23, G0.3/G0.4/G0.5 2026-07-24, G0.6 earlier) but this shows the STRUCTURE holds,
not that it is nontrivial for the real root — that remains open; the 4D correlation defect and
continuum `σ_phys` (§2); uniqueness of the matter skeleton over ALL representations, not just the
declared minimal alphabet (§3); `⟨Ξ⟩≠0` and interacting chiral gauge measure (§4); the primitive
cost ratios behind isotropy and full interacting Lorentz covariance (§5); whether `Π₀>α` is FORCED
(§6); real spectral-transfer pole masses (§7); everything in §8–§10.

Also never conflate: `Ξ∈{+1,−1}` (orientation order, chirality selector, v1.7) with
`H=(1,2)_{1/2}` (electroweak order carrier, v1.12–v1.13) — distinct records, distinct roles.
Never cite the superseded exponential order-closure ansatz (§6) as canonical.

## One-line verdict
> **Root-Native Standard-Model Architecture: substantial conditional and node-level closure —
> not a complete Standard Model derived from the unrestricted root.** Saying exactly this is the
> closure.
